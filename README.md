# React Router v4

Followed lessons from the egghead course: [Add routing to React apps using *React Router v4* by *Joe Maddalone*](https://egghead.io/courses/add-routing-to-react-apps-using-react-router-v4)

Some of the examples of use of **React Router 4** can be seen on the different commits:
* Add Basic Routes
* Use Link for Component for nav
* Style Active Link with NavLink
* Use URL Parameters
* Use RegEx with Routes
* Render Catch-All Routes with Switch Component
* Render Multiple Components for the same Route
* Render nested Routes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
